# Gas Station Network Smart Contract

## Overview
This smart contract implements a Gas Station Network (GSN) on the Stacks blockchain, allowing users to execute transactions without holding STX for gas fees. The contract acts as a relay hub that manages authorized relayers, user deposits, and transaction forwarding.

## Features
- Meta-transaction processing
- Relay management system
- User balance tracking
- Secure signature verification
- Emergency fund recovery
- Ownership management

## Contract Files
- gas-station-network.clar: Main contract implementation
- relay-manager.clar: Optional separate relay management module
- gsn-interfaces.clar: Optional interface definitions

## Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Clarinet

## Contract Architecture

### Core Components

1. *Access Control*
   - Contract administrator management
   - Relay authorization system
   - Permission verification

2. *Balance Management*
   - User deposits
   - Withdrawal processing
   - Balance tracking

3. *Transaction Processing*
   - Meta-transaction handling
   - Signature verification
   - Nonce management

## Usage

### For Users

1. *Depositing Funds*

(contract-call? .gas-station-network deposit-funds)


2. *Withdrawing Funds*
clarity
(contract-call? .gas-station-network withdraw-funds u1000)


### For Relayers

1. *Register as Relayer*
clarity
;; Must be called by contract administrator
(contract-call? .gas-station-network add-authorized-relay tx-sender)


2. *Process Transaction*
clarity
(contract-call? 
    .gas-station-network 
    process-relayed-transaction
    user-address
    destination-contract
    "transfer"
    (list "arg1" "arg2")
    gas-price
    gas-limit
    signature)


### For Administrators

1. *Transfer Ownership*

(contract-call? .gas-station-network transfer-contract-ownership new-admin-address)


2. *Emergency Recovery*
clarity
(contract-call? .gas-station-network emergency-fund-recovery)


## Security Considerations

1. *Signature Verification*
   - All relayed transactions require valid signatures
   - Nonce tracking prevents replay attacks
   - Proper principal validation

2. *Access Control*
   - Only authorized relayers can process transactions
   - Administrative functions restricted to contract owner
   - Balance checks before transfers

3. *Fund Safety*
   - Emergency recovery function
   - Balance tracking per user
   - Safe arithmetic operations

## Error Codes

- ERROR-UNAUTHORIZED (u100): Unauthorized access attempt
- ERROR-INVALID-RELAY-ADDRESS (u101): Relay not authorized
- ERROR-INSUFFICIENT-USER-BALANCE (u102): Insufficient funds
- ERROR-INVALID-TRANSACTION-SIGNATURE (u103): Invalid signature

## Gas Cost Optimization

The contract implements several gas optimization techniques:
1. Efficient data storage using maps
2. Minimal state changes
3. Optimized signature verification
4. Batch processing where possible
